                                    Many data scientists rely on automated pipelines to streamline predictive modeling and machine learning workflows. 
                                    But did you know how easy it is to incorporate Python models into these pipelines using SAS software?  This 
                                    integration allows you to get the best of both worlds—leveraging the robustness and scalability of SAS Viya 
                                    alongside the flexibility and innovation of open-source tools to seamless compare, review, and crown a 
                                    champion model. Join us to explore how open-source models can fit into an end-to-end machine learning 
                                    process, enabling efficiency, reproducibility, and scalability.

                                    <strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
                                    Operations Research and Management Science (ORMS) may have begun as a highly technical field rooted in mathematics 
                                    and engineering, but today it underpins what we call data analytics and data science—and it is no longer reserved 
                                    for specialists. Modern tools, including generative AI, have lowered the barriers so that anyone, regardless of 
                                    major or background, can use data to describe patterns, predict outcomes, and prescribe better decisions. In fact
                                    , employers across every industry now expect graduates to have this capability, whether they are in marketing, 
                                    finance, supply chain, or even the arts. Today, we also live in a moment of unprecedented opportunity: at our 
                                    fingertips are tools that not only help us succeed in our careers but also empower us to serve and love others, 
                                    create data-driven solutions to social challenges, and make generational impacts that extend far beyond ourselves. 
                                    This talk traces ORMS from its origins in World War II logistics to its modern role in business and society, 
                                    showing how its core principles—descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics—shape decisions that affect 
                                    millions. Through historical stories and contemporary examples, students will see how ORMS has evolved into a 
                                    practical skillset that enables both professional success and meaningful contributions to the world.
